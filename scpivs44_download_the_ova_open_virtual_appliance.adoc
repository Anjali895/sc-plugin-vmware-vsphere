Before installing the OVA add the certificate to the vCenter and then begin the installation. The SCV OVA is packaged as a TAR that contains the OVA file, certificates combined into a single PEM file, and instructions on how to add the certificate to the vCenter.

[IMPORTANT]
In VMware vCenter (7.0.3) versions and higher, the OVA signed by the Entrust certificate is no longer trusted.
