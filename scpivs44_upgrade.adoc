== #Upgrade from an earlier release of SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere#

#If you are using the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance, you can upgrade to a newer release.#

.Before you begin

If you are upgrading to a new patch of the same release, you must clear the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere cache on the vCenter Web Server and restart the server before the upgrade or registration.

If the plug-in cache is not cleared, then recent jobs are not displayed in the Dashboard and job monitor in the following scenarios:

* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere was deployed using vCenter, and then later upgraded to a patch in the same release.
* The SnapCenter VMware virtual appliance was deployed in vCenter 1. Later, this SnapCenter VMware plug-in was registered to a new vCenter2. A new instance of the SnapCenter VMware plug-in is created with a patch and registered to vCenter1. However, because vCenter1 still has the cached plug-in from the first SnapCenter VMware plug-in without the patch, the cache needs to be cleared.

The cache is in the following locations, based on the type of server operating system:

* vCenter Server for Windows
+
`C:\ProgramData\VMware\vCenterServer\cfg\vsphere-client\vc-packages\vsphere-client-serenity\ `

* vCenter Server Linux Appliance
+
`/etc/vmware/vsphere-client/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/ `

* Windows OS
+
`%PROGRAMFILES%/VMware/vSphere Web Client/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/ `

* Mac OS
+
`/var/lib/vmware/vsphere-client/vsphere-client/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/ `

Steps for clearing the cache:

. Locate the `vsphere-client-serenity` folder, then locate the `com.netapp.scvm.webclient-4.2.0` folder and delete it.
+
The folder name changes for each release.

. Restart the vCenter Server.
+
You can then upgrade the SnapCenter VMware plug-in.
