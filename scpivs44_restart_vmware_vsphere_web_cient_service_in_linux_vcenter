If your vCenter is on a Linux appliance, then you must use Linux commands to restart the VMware vSphere web client service.

.Before you begin

You must be running vCenter 6.5 or later.

.Steps

. Use SSH to log in to the vCenter Server Appliance as root.
. Access the Appliance Shell or BASH Shell by using the following command:
+
`shell`

. Stop the web client service by using the following HTML5 command:
+
`service-control --stop vsphere-ui`

. Delete all stale scvm packages on vCenter by using the following HTML5 command:
+
`etc/vmware/vsphere-ui/vc-packages/vsphere-client-serenity/`
+
`rm -rf com.netapp.scvm.webclient-<version_number>`
+
[IMPORTANT]
Do not remove the VASA or VSC7.x and later packages.

. Start the web client service by using the following HTML5 command:
+
`service-control --start vsphere-ui`
