== Migrate from Windows-based SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere

#If you are using the Windows-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in and want to use the new features provided by the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere virtual appliance, you must deploy the virtual appliance and migrate your backup metadata.#

.Before you begin

If your backups of virtualized databases and filesystems are integrated with SnapCenter:

* If the SnapCenter server is a VM, then it is a best practice to take a VMware-based snapshot before upgrading.
* Make sure the SnapCenter server is upgraded. See the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2873358[SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere Release Notes^] for information on supported upgrade paths.

.About this task

There are four basic steps:

. Download the upgrade .`iso` file.
. Suspend backup jobs for the Windows-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in.
. Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere OVA.
. Migrate the Windows-based VMware backup metadata.

.Steps

. Download the upgrade .`iso` file.
.. Log in to the NetApp Support Site (https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html[https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/index.html^]).
.. From the list of products, select *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere*, then click the *DOWNLOAD LATEST RELEASE* button.
.. Download the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere upgrade .`iso` file to any VM.
. Suspend backup jobs.
+
In the SnapCenter GUI, suspend all jobs for the Windows-based SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere.

. Deploy the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere OVA.
+
Because this is a new installation of the Linux-based SnapCenter VMware plug-in, follow the steps for deploying the OVA.
